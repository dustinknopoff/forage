Was watching [Decrusted: Serde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oVIyNiAiss) and found out when you derive `#[serde(Deserialize, Serialize)]` it _can_ be to an array as opposed to a mapping of some key:value.

This is especially helpful as I've got some little automations which query Fastmail via [jmap](https://jmap.io) which heavily utilizes arrays for defining what query to run.

i.e. 

```rs
#[derive(serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize)]
struct RGB {
  r: u64,
  g: u64,
  b: u64
}
```

can correctly deserialize `[12,222,55]` into a Rust struct with named fields!
