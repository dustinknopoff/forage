I've recently discovered [Indieblog](https://indieblog.page) which provides an index of independent blog feeds across the internet and a random button to go an article on any of them.

Through that I've found this post: [Consistency Originality Gratification](https://blog.robertsimoes.org/perspectives/consistency-originality-gratification/).

I've read it 3 times now and every time now I feel like there is more layers of life that this applies to than what I originally thought.

In particular, is an apt and key quote to hold on to.
