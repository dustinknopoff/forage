After reading Josh Comeau's excellent blog post on [color in css](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/color-formats/), I decided to experiment with using `lch` colors on this site.

It was a nice surprise that the fallback format which I typically only use for fonts, i.e.

```css
font-family: 'Roboto', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif;
```

not only also works for colors, but it also works as css variables and automatically drops unsupported color selection. (That is, since `lch` colors are currently only supported in Safari, it silently uses the fallback `hsl` color)

```css
  --primary-color: lch(12.74% 0 139.088), hsl(0, 0%, 13%); 
  /* lch will be used in safari and other browsers will automatically use hsl */
```

Also, [https://css.land/lch/](https://css.land/lch/) is a nice little utility.
