Listening to [JSParty](https://changelog.com/jsparty/271) introduced me  to an excellent article [Good conversations have lots of doorknobs](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/good-conversations-have-lots-of-doorknobs).

The most exciting bits was the concept of conversational affordances and how they they're the key to conversations that click.
This comes on the tails of recently reading _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ and _The Fine Art of Small Talk_. I find the concept of conversational affordances a more refined and realistic take on the general takeaway of those two books: Listening is an essential part of conversations; Pummel your ego out of the way as much as you can.

Three bits that really stuck with me were

> Conversational affordances are things like digressions and confessions and bold claims that beg for a rejoinder. 

> What matters most, then, is not how much we give or take, but whether we offer and accept affordances

> Conversational affordances often require saying something at least a little bit intimate about yourself, so even the faintest fear of rejection on either side can prevent conversations from taking off

This was one of those articles that felt like I came across it at exactly the right moment, primed by doing Improve, interest in improving my conversational skills, and having spoken 2 hours earlier with friends about it.
