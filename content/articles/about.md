title: About Me

---

:wave: I'm Dustin, a fullstack developer originally from Connecticut and currently based in London, UK working for Yelp.

I'm obsessed with making people more _efficient_. It brings me joy to help with automating the repetitive tasks in their life. In code, I find Rust scratches a similar itch of fearless efficiency but, I'm attempting my best to implement the practices taught in [Grokking Simplicity](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-simplicity) in areas where using Rust isn't possible.

Outside of coding (and consuming all the medias, check out my [favorites here](/library)), I love to cook, bake, design things, and a variety of atypical physical exercise. Specifically I've dabbled in Taekwondo, BJJ, Wing Chun, Parkour, and Aerial Silks.
