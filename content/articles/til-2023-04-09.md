Listened to two fantastic podcasts today [Rick Glassman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Hs5LSHuseL8) and [The Fundamentalists](https://thefundamentalists.podbean.com/e/the-myth-of-hustle-culture/)

The most interesting tidbits being

Harry Mack stating

> Being true to your self is about being present

And from the Myth of Hustle Culture

> To be human is to desire knowing what the other wants

> The soul is that which turns events into experiences
