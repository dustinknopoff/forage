The YouTube algorithm recommended [The 1975: ‘Being Funny In a Foreign Language’ Interview | Apple Music](https://youtu.be/d3ZHGfcENuk?t=561) of which I've developed a great deal of respect for Matt Healy, his outlook on life, and his ability to articulate it.

The part that stuck out was a word he made up and defined: sceneius

>  Someone of exceptional capacity to recognize an environment and create new something from it

This is a paraphrase of the actual quote but I think it is quite accurate. It really opened my eyes to the commonalities between music and starting a business/disruption in general.

A person with vision for a successful disruption not only needs to:
- have a good idea
- the capacity to execute on it
- be capable of explaining to others their idea
- understand how this idea differs from what's come before

But they also need to be able to read the scene or environment to know if this is the **right** moment to introduce a disruption. It's not uncommon to hear of failed startups because it "wasn't the right time"
